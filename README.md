# Image-Encryption-using-RSA-algorithm

# Problem statement

Organ trafficking is a broad concept that includes several illegal activities for the sole purpose of transplantation. The scan images play a major in organ trafficking as these images can be helpful for the hackers to breach into the database and collect the images. By encrypting the images using a suitable algorithm, we could solve these kind of real-life problems. 

# Implementation
1. Pre-processing
2. RSA algorithm execution
3. Encryption
4. Decryption

# Conclusion

Encrypted images can be stored in hopsital databases, making it difficult for the intruder to attack and the hospital management can get back the images by decrypting them, using its private key.
